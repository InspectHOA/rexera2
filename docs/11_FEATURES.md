## Email Threading System

### Overview

The Email Threading System provides Gmail-style email conversation management for Rexera 2.0 workflows. It groups related emails into threads, maintains conversation continuity, and provides comprehensive email analytics for workflow communication tracking.

### Core Features

#### 1. Gmail-Style Threading
- **Automatic Thread Grouping**: Emails are automatically grouped by subject and conversation flow
- **Subject Normalization**: Removes "Re:", "Fwd:", and other prefixes for consistent threading
- **Reference Chain Tracking**: Maintains email reference headers for proper conversation flow
- **Participant Management**: Tracks all participants across the entire conversation

#### 2. Conversation Continuity
- **Reply Chain Maintenance**: Preserves In-Reply-To and References headers
- **Thread Subject Consistency**: Maintains original subject with proper reply prefixes
- **Message Ordering**: Chronological ordering within threads
- **Conversation Context**: Full conversation history available for each thread

#### 3. Email Status Tracking
- **Delivery Status**: SENT, DELIVERED, READ, BOUNCED, FAILED
- **Read Receipts**: Track when emails are opened (when supported)
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Real-time delivery status updates
- **Bounce Handling**: Automatic bounce detection and handling

#### 4. Thread Management
- **Thread Status**: ACTIVE, RESOLVED, ARCHIVED
- **Priority Levels**: LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT
- **Label System**: Flexible tagging for organization
- **Client Visibility**: Control which threads are visible to clients

### Technical Architecture

#### Database Schema
**Note:** All database schema definitions for the Email Threading System are centralized in [`design-docs/02_DB_SCHEMA.md`](02_DB_SCHEMA.md). The email threading system uses the following simplified tables:

- **[`emails`](02_DB_SCHEMA.md)** - Simplified email table with essential threading support: thread_id, in_reply_to, email_status, and direction fields
- **[`email_threads`](02_DB_SCHEMA.md)** - Simplified conversation grouping with subject, status, priority, and visibility controls

**Key Simplifications:**
- Removed redundant fields (conversation_id, references array, delivery_status JSONB)
- Eliminated computed fields (message_count, unread_count, participants array, last_message_id)
- Streamlined status tracking with simple enums
- Cleaner one-to-many relationship between threads and emails

#### Threading Algorithm

**Subject Normalization**
```typescript
function normalizeSubject(subject: string): string {
  return subject
    .replace(/^(Re:|RE:|Fwd:|FWD:|Fw:)\s*/gi, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
    .trim();
}
```

**Simplified Thread Grouping Logic**
1. **In-Reply-To Header**: Primary method for threading replies
2. **Subject-Based Grouping**: Fallback for emails without reply headers
3. **Workflow Scoping**: All threads scoped to specific workflows

**Simplified Message Threading Process**
```typescript
async function threadEmail(email: EmailMessage): Promise<EmailThread> {
  // 1. Check for existing thread by In-Reply-To header
  if (email.inReplyTo) {
    const parentMessage = await findMessageByMessageId(email.inReplyTo);
    if (parentMessage?.threadId) {
      return await addToExistingThread(parentMessage.threadId, email);
    }
  }
  
  // 2. Check for existing thread by normalized subject within workflow
  const normalizedSubject = normalizeSubject(email.subject);
  const existingThread = await findThreadBySubject(
    email.workflowId,
    normalizedSubject
  );
  
  if (existingThread) {
    return await addToExistingThread(existingThread.id, email);
  }
  
  // 3. Create new thread
  return await createNewThread(email);
}
```

### API Integration

#### Notification Creation
```javascript
// Example: Create task failure notification
await createNotification({
  user_id: task.executor_id,
  type: 'TASK_INTERRUPT',
  priority: 'HIGH',
  title: `Task Failed: ${task.task_type}`,
  message: `${agentName} encountered an error in ${workflow.type}: ${errorMessage}`,
  action_url: `/workflows/${workflow.id}/tasks/${task.id}`,
  metadata: {
    workflow_id: workflow.id,
    task_id: task.id,
    agent_name: agentName,
    error_code: errorCode
  }
});
```
