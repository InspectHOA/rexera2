## Legend
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Feature is built and deployed
- üöß **In Progress**: Feature is partially implemented
- ‚ùå **Planned**: Feature is planned but not started

## Priority Levels
1. **P0**: Critical for core functionality
2. **P1**: Important for user experience
3. **P2**: Nice to have features
4. **P3**: Future enhancements

## Tracking Options

### Option 1: GitHub Issues + Projects
**Pros:**
- Native GitHub integration
- Link issues to PRs automatically
- Project boards for visual tracking
- Labels for categories (P0, P1, etc.)
- Milestones for releases

**Setup:**
1. Create GitHub Project board
2. Convert each roadmap item to GitHub issue
3. Use labels: `feature`, `testing`, `infrastructure`, `P0-P3`
4. Link issues to this roadmap document

### Option 2: Keep Markdown + GitHub Issues Hybrid
**Pros:**
- Roadmap stays in docs (version controlled)
- Create issues only for active work
- Reference issues in roadmap: `- [x] Feature name (#123)`

**Setup:**
1. Keep this roadmap as source of truth
2. Create issues for items being worked on
3. Link back to roadmap in issue descriptions
4. Update roadmap when issues close

### Option 3: External Tools
- **Linear**: Advanced project management, great for startups
- **Notion**: Rich documentation + project tracking
- **Asana/Monday**: Traditional project management
- **GitHub Projects V2**: Enhanced project boards with custom fields

### Recommended: Hybrid Approach
1. Keep this roadmap document as high-level overview
2. Create GitHub issues for active development items
3. Reference issue numbers in roadmap: `- [x] Feature (#123)`
4. Use GitHub Project board for sprint planning
5. Update roadmap monthly during reviews

## CLI Tools for GitHub Issues

### GitHub CLI (gh)
**Install:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux/Windows
# Download from https://cli.github.com/
```

**Basic Commands:**
```bash
# Create issue
gh issue create --title "Implement SLA monitoring" --body "Add automated SLA tracking system" --label "feature,P1"

# List issues
gh issue list

# View issue
gh issue view 123

# Close issue
gh issue close 123

# Create from template
gh issue create --template bug_report.md
```

**Bulk Create from Roadmap:**
```bash
# Create issues for all planned features
gh issue create --title "Client Portal Dashboard" --label "feature,P2" --body "Build client-facing dashboard for order tracking"
gh issue create --title "SLA Warning System" --label "feature,P1" --body "Implement automated SLA monitoring and warnings"
gh issue create --title "Frontend Unit Tests" --label "testing,P1" --body "Add comprehensive unit test coverage for React components"
```

**Project Integration:**
```bash
# Add issue to project
gh issue create --title "Feature" --label "P1" | gh project item-add 1 --url -

# Link to existing project
gh project item-add 1 --url https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```
