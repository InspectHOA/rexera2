## Architecture Overview

This project is a workflow automation platform where n8n orchestrates complex business processes by calling a suite of external, specialized AI agent services. The backend API and database serve as a simple "log book," atomically recording the outcomes of each step that n8n completes. The frontend provides a complete view of the workflow's progress by combining the static process definition with the execution logs, and it serves as the dashboard for Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) operators to resolve any flagged interrupts.

Rexera 2.0 is an AI-powered real estate workflow automation platform with a sophisticated **dual-layer architecture**:

### Layer 1: Technical Orchestration (n8n Cloud)
- Handles complex workflow logic and AI agent coordination
- Manages external API integrations and data transformations
- Provides robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Executes 3 core workflow types: Municipal Lien Search, HOA Acquisition, Payoff Request

### Layer 2: Business Visibility (PostgreSQL + Next.js)
- Provides human-friendly interfaces for HIL (Human-in-the-Loop) operators
- Stores business-critical data and relationships in 35+ PostgreSQL tables
- Enables real-time reporting and analytics
- Supports cross-workflow coordination and SLA monitoring

## Integration Patterns & Workflow Execution

### The "Log Book" Architecture: Static Blueprint + Dynamic Log

Rexera 2.0's task execution architecture is built on a simple and powerful philosophy: the database serves as an **immutable log of completed work**, not a state machine for pending tasks. This separation of concerns creates a robust, scalable, and easily debuggable system.

-   **Static Blueprint (Workflow Definition):** The complete plan for any workflow is defined in a static JSON file (e.g., `PAYOFF_REQUEST.json`). This file contains a `taskSequence` array that lists all potential steps in their intended order. This is the "to-do list" and is the source of truth for the UI.

-   **Dynamic Log (Database):** The database, specifically the `task_executions` table, only records work that has already been completed. It is the "log book" of what has happened. It does not know or care about what tasks are pending.

-   **`taskType` Identifier:** A human-readable string (e.g., `"identify_lender_contact"`) is the shared key that links the static blueprint to the dynamic log entries created by `n8n`.

### The Execution Flow

This diagram illustrates how a workflow proceeds from start to finish under the new model:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Application Backend"
        A[1. Start Workflow] --> B(Create `workflows` record);
        B --> C{Pass `workflow_id` to n8n};
    end

    subgraph "n8n Workflow Engine"
        C --> D[2. Execute Step 1 logic<br/>(e.g., taskType: 'identify_lender_contact')];
        D --> E[Agent completes work];
        E --> F{3. Report Result via Webhook};
    end

    subgraph "Application Backend"
        F --> G["POST /api/webhooks/n8n<br/>Receives `workflow_id`, `taskType`, and `result`"];
        G --> H[4. Create `task_executions` record<br/>(The immutable log entry)];
        H --> I[...next step in n8n];
    end
```

### API Interaction: The `n8n` Webhook

All communication from `n8n` to the Rexera backend happens through a single, unified webhook endpoint. Instead of telling the backend to perform actions (like starting or completing a task), `n8n` simply reports events that have already occurred.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/webhooks/n8n`

#### `n8n` Reporting Payload

When an `n8n` node finishes a task, it sends a simple payload to the webhook:

```json
// Example from an n8n "HTTP Request" node
{
  "eventType": "agent_task_completed",
  "data": {
    "workflow_id": "{{ $json.workflow_id }}",
    "taskType": "identify_lender_contact",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "result": {
      "contacts": [
        {
          "name": "Big Bank Mortgage Dept.",
          "email": "payoffs@bigbank.com",
          "phone": "1-800-555-1234"
        }
      ],
      "confidenceScore": 0.95
    },
    "agentName": "nina",
    "executionTime": 4500
  }
}
```

#### Backend Logging Logic (Conceptual)

The backend's responsibility is to validate the incoming event and create a corresponding record in the `task_executions` table. It does not manage state; it simply logs the event.

```javascript
// Conceptual handler for the /api/webhooks/n8n endpoint

// 1. Validate the incoming payload against a schema.
const { eventType, data } = validatePayload(req.body);

// 2. Prepare the data for the database log.
const executionLogEntry = {
  workflow_id: data.workflow_id,
  task_type: data.taskType, // The shared identifier
  action_type: 'execute', // Or derived from eventType
  status: data.status, // 'COMPLETED' or 'FAILED'
  output_data: data.result,
  agent_name: data.agentName,
  // ... and other relevant fields
};

// 3. Insert the immutable record into the log.
await supabase
  .from('task_executions')
  .insert(executionLogEntry);

// 4. Send a simple success response.
res.status(200).json({ success: true });
```

This architecture ensures that `n8n` remains the master of the workflow process, while the Rexera application provides a robust, real-time view into the execution history without managing complex state.

## Development Guidelines & Patterns

### üéØ Type Safety & Validation
1. **Zod-First APIs**: Use `@rexera/schemas` for all API endpoints
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ API validation with Zod
   const createWorkflowSchema = z.object({
     title: z.string().min(1),
     workflow_type: z.enum(['HOA_ACQUISITION', 'MUNICIPAL_LIEN_SEARCH'])
   });
   ```

2. **Dual Package System**:
   - `@rexera/schemas` - Runtime validation + type inference for APIs
   - `@rexera/types` - Shared enums, utilities, external service types

3. **Strict TypeScript**: Enable strict mode, use proper typing throughout

### üèóÔ∏è Code Organization
1. **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns, follow established patterns
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions
3. **Component Structure**: Organize by feature, not by file type
4. **Import Order**: External deps ‚Üí Internal packages ‚Üí Relative imports

### üöÄ Modern Patterns
1. **Next.js App Router**: Use server components, streaming, and modern patterns
2. **Turbo Orchestration**: Leverage Turbo for build optimization and caching  
3. **pnpm Workspaces**: Use `workspace:*` for internal dependencies
4. **Real-Time**: Implement live updates with Supabase subscriptions

### ‚úÖ Quality Standards
1. **Testing**: Write tests, run type checks before committing
2. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful degradation and HIL escalation
3. **Database**: Use migrations in `supabase/migrations/` for schema changes
4. **API Design**: Follow REST principles with standardized response formats
5. **Performance**: Optimize for both developer experience and runtime performance

### üîß Development Workflow
1. **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches with descriptive names
2. **Code Review**: All changes go through review process
3. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
4. **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md updated with architectural changes
